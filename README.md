### data
Data CSV is stored in [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/spreadsheets/d/1IHocOhSxwA9XkO6rznmetSz_ATBIAPHgms4htOEd-tk/edit?usp=sharing) and looks like this:

![data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auremoser/msl-gantt/gh-pages/assets/sheet.png)

Headers are static, but all values are editable in the data.csv file.

deliverable	| priority	| start_date	| end_date 	| team | type
:---:	| :----: 	| :--------: 	| :------: 	| :----: | :----:
project1 | value1 	| date1 		| date2 	| [Abby/Aurelia/...] | community
project2 | value2 	| date1 		| date2 	| [Abby/Aurelia/...] | logistics

#### key
* **deliverable** is project name
* **priority** is an arbitrary weight (maybe priority of a project, maybe hours of investment, maybe resources used), in this case, it's roughly the number of hours a project will take [1]
* **dates** are the start and end date of a project
* **team** is the name of the team responsible for the deliverable
* **type** is one of several categories for filtering purposes (community, logistics, assessment, convenings, trainings...)[2]

[1]: We can decide what numerical value to prioritize by, I just wanted to log this as a sortable placeholder for future values we might want to track.

[2]: Milestones are vertical plum lines on the chart. You can draw a plum line, as opposed to a bar, by entering a deliverable name, start_date and type of project as "milestone"). Check the csv for examples of this.
